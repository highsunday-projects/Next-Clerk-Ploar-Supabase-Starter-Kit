   - **Permissions**: Select required permissions (recommend selecting all permissions)
5. Copy and securely save API Token

**API Token Format**:
- **Sandbox**: `polar_oat_xxxxxxxxxx`
- **Production**: `polar_oat_xxxxxxxxxx`

### Step 5: Configure Webhook

1. In Polar Dashboard go to "Settings" > "Webhooks"
2. Click "Create Webhook"
3. Configure Webhook:
   - **URL**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/polar` **(Important: Must include `/api/webhooks/polar` path)**
   - **Events**: Check the following events
     - `checkout.created`
     - `order.created`
     - `order.paid`
     - `subscription.created`
     - `subscription.updated`
     - `subscription.uncanceled`

**Webhook URL Description**:
- ‚úÖ Correct format: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/polar`
- ‚úÖ Development environment: `https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/polar`
- ‚ùå Wrong format: `https://yourdomain.com` (missing path)
- ‚ùå Wrong format: `https://yourdomain.com/webhooks/polar` (incorrect path)

After creating Webhook, Polar will provide a Secret:
- **Format**: 32-character hexadecimal string (e.g., `a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234ab`)
- **Purpose**: Verify authenticity of Webhook requests

**Development Environment Testing Instructions**:

Since Webhooks require public URLs, in development environment we use ngrok to expose local localhost to the internet for testing:

```bash
# 1. Install ngrok (if not already installed)
npm install -g ngrok

# 2. Start your development server
npm run dev  # Usually on port 3000

# 3. Start ngrok tunnel in another terminal window
ngrok http 3000

# 4. ngrok will provide a public URL, similar to:
# Forwarding    https://abc123.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:3000

# 5. Set the ngrok provided URL to Polar Webhook (Important: add /api/webhooks/polar)
# Example: https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/polar
```

**Important Reminders**:
- ngrok will expose your localhost:3000 to the public internet
- Each restart of ngrok generates a new URL, requiring Polar Webhook settings update
- This is only for development testing, use real domain names for production environment

### Step 6: Environment Variables Configuration

Add the following environment variables to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Polar Configuration
POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN=polar_oat_xxxxxxxxxx
POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET=a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234ab
POLAR_ORGANIZATION_ID=12345678-abcd-1234-5678-123456789abc
NEXT_PUBLIC_POLAR_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox

# Polar Product IDs  
NEXT_PUBLIC_POLAR_PRO_PRODUCT_ID=prod_xxxxxxxxxx
```

**Environment Variables Description**:

| Variable Name | Description | Example Value |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| `POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Polar API access token | `polar_oat_xxx` |
| `POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Webhook signature verification key | `a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234ab` |
| `POLAR_ORGANIZATION_ID` | Organization ID | `12345678-abcd-1234-5678-123456789abc` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_POLAR_ENVIRONMENT` | Environment setting | `sandbox` or `production` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_POLAR_PRO_PRODUCT_ID` | Pro plan product ID | `prod_xxx` |

### Step 7: Test Configuration

```bash
# Test API connection
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     https://sandbox-api.polar.sh/v1/organizations/YOUR_ORG_ID
```

**Test Product Retrieval**:

```bash
# Test product list
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     https://sandbox-api.polar.sh/v1/products?organization_id=YOUR_ORG_ID
```

**Test Webhook (using ngrok)**:

Since Webhooks require public URLs, in development environment we use ngrok to expose local localhost to the internet for testing:

```bash
# 1. Install ngrok (if not already installed)
npm install -g ngrok

# 2. Start your development server
npm run dev  # Usually on port 3000

# 3. Start ngrok tunnel in another terminal window
ngrok http 3000

# 4. ngrok will provide a public URL, similar to:
# Forwarding    https://abc123.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:3000

# 5. Set the ngrok provided URL to Polar Webhook (Important: add /api/webhooks/polar)
# Example: https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/polar
```

**Important Notes**:
- ngrok will expose your localhost:3000 to the public internet
- Each restart of ngrok generates a new URL, requiring Polar Webhook settings update
- This is only for development testing, use real domain names for production environment

## üéÅ Recommended Configuration

## üß™ Testing and Verification

### Test Checklist

#### Account and Organization Testing
- [ ] Successfully register Polar account
- [ ] Create organization and obtain Organization ID
- [ ] Product creation successful, obtain Product ID
- [ ] API Token correctly generated and saved

#### API Connection Testing
- [ ] API test calls successfully return organization information
- [ ] Product list API correctly returns product data
- [ ] Environment variables correctly loaded and used
- [ ] Sandbox and Production environments properly distinguished

#### Webhook Integration Testing
- [ ] Webhook URL configured correctly
- [ ] Test events can be triggered and received properly
- [ ] Webhook signature verification works normally
- [ ] Local development environment ngrok testing successful

#### Database Integration Testing  
- [ ] Supabase database migration executed successfully

- [ ] Webhook Secret correctly configured and verified
- [ ] Environment variables security check
- [ ] Production environment configuration isolated from test environment

### Testing Steps

#### 1. Basic API Connection Testing
```bash
# Test organization information
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     https://sandbox-api.polar.sh/v1/organizations/YOUR_ORG_ID

# Test product list
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
     https://sandbox-api.polar.sh/v1/products?organization_id=YOUR_ORG_ID
```

#### 2. Local Webhook Testing (using ngrok)
```bash
# 1. Ensure development server is running
npm run dev

# 2. Start ngrok in new terminal window
ngrok http 3000

# 3. Copy ngrok provided HTTPS URL
# Example: https://abc123.ngrok.io

# 4. Go to Polar Dashboard to update Webhook URL
# Set to: https://abc123.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/polar
```

**ngrok Usage Instructions**:
- ngrok maps local localhost:3000 to public HTTPS URL
- This allows Polar to send Webhook events to your local development environment
- Suitable for testing Webhook functionality during development phase

#### 3. Integration Flow Testing
- Create test user in application
- Simulate subscription flow
- Check customer and subscription data in Polar Dashboard
- Verify Webhook events are processed correctly

**Important: Subscription Status Check**
If subscription succeeds but Dashboard still shows free version, this usually indicates:
- ‚úÖ Polar payment processing successful
- ‚ùå Webhook events not processed correctly
- üîß Need to check Webhook configuration and processing logic

**Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. Check if subscription record exists in Polar Dashboard
2. Confirm Webhook URL is correctly configured: must include `/api/webhooks/polar` path
3. Test if Webhook URL is accessible (especially important when using ngrok)
4. Check application logs for Webhook event reception records
5. Verify Webhook Secret is correctly configured

#### 4. Credit Card Payment Testing
In Sandbox environment, you can use test credit cards for payment testing:

**Test Card Information** (Source: [Stripe Test Cards Documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/testing)):

| Card Brand | Card Number | CVC | Expiry Date | Description |
|------------|-------------|-----|-------------|-------------|
| **Visa** | `4242424242424242` | Any 3 digits | Any future date | Successful payment test card |
| **Visa** | `4000000000000002` | Any 3 digits | Any future date | Declined payment test card |

**Usage Example**:
```
Test credit card number: Visa    4242424242424242    Any 3 digits    Any future date
Expiry date: 12/34
CVC: 123
Postal code: 10001 (or any valid postal code)
```

**Notes**:
- Only use test cards in Sandbox environment
- Test cards will not generate actual charges
- Can test various payment scenarios (success, failure, requires verification, etc.)
